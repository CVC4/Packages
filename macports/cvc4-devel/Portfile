description         First order formula validity checker (version 4)
long_description    CVC4 is a tool for determining the satisfiability of a first order formula \
                    modulo a first order theory (or a combination of such theories). It is the \
                    fourth in the Cooperating Validity Checker family of tools (CVC, CVC Lite, \
                    CVC3) but does not directly incorporate code from any previous version. \
                    \
                    CVC4 is intended to be an open and extensible SMT engine. It can be used \
                    as a stand-alone tool or as a library. It has been designed to increase \
                    the performance and reduce the memory overhead of its predecessors. \
                    \
                    This version is a developmental snapshot release.  For a stable version, \
                    please use the "cvc4" package instead.
